## Review

Garudan revolves around the strong bond of friendship between two characters, Adhi and Karuna, highlighting themes of trust, loyalty, and mutual understanding. The film captures a range of emotions, from joy to sorrow, making it a compelling watch.

The performances by the lead actors—Soori, Sasikumar, and Unni Mukundan—are exceptional, each bringing depth to their roles. The female cast, including Sshivada, Roshni Haripriyan, and Revathi Sharma, adds richness to the narrative with their impactful performances.

The film’s cinematography by Arthur A. Wilson enhances its visual appeal, using lighting and angles that resonate with the story's emotions. Yuvan Shankar Raja’s music score further elevates the film, intensifying key moments and providing a memorable experience.

Garudan is not just an action film; it's an emotional rollercoaster that delves into the complexities of friendship and human relationships.
