## Review

Thangalaan takes us back to the British Raj era, showcasing the story of Thangalaan, a brave tribal leader played by Vikram. The film emphasizes themes of identity and resistance against colonial rule. Vikram's performance is intense and nuanced, making viewers feel the weight of his character's struggles. The female leads, portrayed by Parvathy Thiruvothu and Malavika Mohanan, add depth to the narrative with their strong and relatable characters.

The cinematography by Kishor Kumar captures the beauty and brutality of the Kolar region, enhancing the film's emotional impact. The editing by Selva RK keeps the pace tight, ensuring viewers are engaged throughout. G. V. Prakash Kumar's music complements the visuals perfectly, creating an immersive experience.

Overall, Thangalaan is more than just a movie; itâ€™s a conversation starter about history, representation, and the sacrifices of tribal communities in India's independence struggle.
