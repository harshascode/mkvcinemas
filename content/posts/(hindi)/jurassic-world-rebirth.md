## Rebirth Review: A Fresh Hunt for Dino DNA

"Jurassic World: Rebirth" certainly tries to breathe new life into the franchise, and in many ways, it succeeds. Director Gareth Edwards brings his signature style of grand scale and tension, making the prehistoric creatures feel truly massive and menacing. He even shot on 35mm film, aiming for that classic "Jurassic Park" look, and it shows.

The plot feels a bit different this time around. Instead of just escaping a park, a team, including big names like Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, goes on a dangerous mission to extract DNA from giant dinosaurs for a medical cure. This gives the film a clear, high-stakes objective beyond mere survival, though plenty of that happens too! Jonathan Bailey, as the paleontologist, brings a much-needed sense of wonder back to seeing these creatures, which has been a strong point of positive feedback.

While critics have had mixed reactions, many agree "Rebirth" is an improvement over some of the recent entries. The visuals are stunning, and Edwards knows how to build suspense, especially in scenes involving the immense dinosaurs. It balances moments of awe with genuine terror, which is what these films do best.

Financially, the movie has been a monster hit, grossing over $575 million globally and ranking as one of the top films of 2025. This proves that despite some mixed reviews, audiences are still eager to witness dinosaurs on the big screen, especially when a skilled director like Edwards is at the helm. If you're looking for a thrilling, visually impressive adventure with a new twist on the dino-DNA premise, "Jurassic World: Rebirth" is worth seeing.
