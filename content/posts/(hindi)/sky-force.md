## Review

The film shines with breathtaking aerial combat scenes and a heartfelt narrative. Nutan Shende’s cinematography captures every intense moment, while Suresh Jagannathan’s editing keeps the story tight. The VFX brings realism to the air battles, though some historical inaccuracies drew criticism. The film, despite its strengths, struggled at the box office.
