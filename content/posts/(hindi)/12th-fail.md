## Review

12th Fail tells the compelling story of Manoj Kumar Sharma, a 12th-grade dropout from Chambal, who dreams of passing the challenging UPSC exam. Vikrant Massey’s portrayal of Manoj is nothing short of remarkable, showcasing a wide range of emotions—from despair to determination.

The film paints a raw and honest picture of his struggles, including taking low-paying jobs just to make ends meet while preparing for the exam.

The narrative effectively captures the educational challenges in India, illustrating how students often resort to cheating due to societal pressures. Through Manoj's journey, we see the impact of a flawed education system and the relentless spirit of students who refuse to give up.

The character development is strong, with every supporting role adding depth to the story, from Manoj’s mentor to his friends, each with their own battles.

The pacing of the film keeps viewers engaged throughout its 147-minute runtime. Chopra expertly weaves in various subplots, ensuring that none feel forced, and each contributes to the overarching theme of resilience. The dialogues, while simple, resonate deeply, reflecting the struggles and emotions of students preparing for the UPSC.

Overall, 12th Fail is not just a film about one man's journey; it's a broader commentary on the education system and the perseverance required to overcome obstacles. It's a must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration or understanding of the UPSC journey.
