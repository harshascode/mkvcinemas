## Review

Stree 2: Sarkate Ka Aatank tries to pick up where its predecessor left off, with a unique blend of horror and comedy. The film is set in the town of Chanderi, where the once-feared ghost, Stree, is now a protector. However, the return of a new villain, Sarkata, disrupts the peace.

The film starts strong with humor, especially in its first 30-40 minutes, but the screenplay begins to feel a bit thin. After the interval, it picks up pace, delivering a thrilling climax with plenty of laughs, thanks to Rajkummar Rao‚Äôs character, Vicky. While Rao‚Äôs performance is charming, his character might come off as repetitive for some viewers.

The film does a good job of using humor to discuss serious themes, like feminism and patriarchy. The gender reversal with Sarkata being a cruel patriarch adds depth to the story, making it more than just a regular horror-comedy. The visual effects are impressive, and the spooky atmosphere is enhanced by a dark setting.

Overall, Stree 2 has its strengths and weaknesses. It might not be perfect, but it‚Äôs an entertaining ride for fans of the genre, especially those who enjoyed the first film.
