## Review

### A Fresh Perspective on Espionage

Ulajh tells the story of Suhana Bhatia, played by Janhvi Kapoor, who comes from a prestigious family in the Indian Foreign Services. As she navigates the challenges of her new job in London, she quickly finds herself entangled in a web of political intrigue and espionage. While the film has a slow buildup, it captures your attention, thanks to Kapoor’s engaging performance.

However, the plot could have been sharper. Some moments feel unrealistic, like why Suhana, despite her intelligence, overlooks crucial background checks on her colleagues. The film hints at deeper themes of trust and betrayal but doesn't fully explore them.

### Strong Performances and Chemistry

Gulshan Devaiah shines as Nakul, Suhana's love interest. Their chemistry is palpable and adds depth to the story. While the supporting cast does a decent job, the film primarily revolves around Kapoor and Devaiah, with a focus on their evolving relationship.

Though the film falls short in some areas, it does provide an engaging watch. With stronger writing and a tighter plot, Ulajh could have truly elevated the spy thriller genre in Indian cinema.
