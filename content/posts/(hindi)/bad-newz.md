## Review

Bad Newz is a romantic comedy that starts off with plenty of humor and charm but loses its way in the second half. The film introduces us to Akhil Chadha, played by Vicky Kaushal, who is a hilarious, over-the-top character dealing with a complicated love life. His romantic interest, Saloni, played by Triptii Dimri, is a talented chef with dreams of culinary fame.

In the first half, the movie shines with its light-hearted and silly moments. Kaushal's performance is delightful; he has great comedic timing and a certain charisma that lights up the screen. Dimri also impresses, bringing life and energy to her character. Together, they create a captivating dynamic that keeps you engaged.

However, as the film progresses, it shifts from comedy to melodrama. The second half is filled with emotional moments that feel forced and detract from the fun tone established earlier. While it's important for a romantic comedy to have some depth, the sudden shift in mood feels jarring and slows down the pace.

Despite the narrative hiccups, Bad Newz does explore interesting themes around relationships, parenthood, and ambition. It touches on serious topics like IVF and modern family dynamics, though sometimes it gets tangled up in its own ideas.

Overall, while Bad Newz has its flaws, it also has memorable moments, especially thanks to Kaushal and Dimri's performances. If you're looking for light entertainment, this film might just be worth a watch.
