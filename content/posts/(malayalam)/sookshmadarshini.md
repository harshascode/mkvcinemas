His return to his family home with his ailing mother appears normal at first, but Priyadarshini’s observations suggest there’s more than meets the eye. The film builds tension through her investigation, leading to an unexpected climax that keeps audiences guessing.

## Cast and Performances

- Nazriya delivers a spirited performance as Priyadarshini, but some viewers find her portrayal too detached to evoke strong empathy.
- Supporting Cast includes Manuel, whose mysterious persona anchors the plot, and a range of characters who add depth to the story’s suspense.

## Review

The screenplay adeptly blends humor and tension, a credit to writers Libin TB and Athul Ramachandran. MC Jithin’s direction keeps the audience engaged, although critics highlight noticeable plot holes that undermine the narrative's logic. While comparisons to Drishyam and Kishkindha Kaandam draw attention to its lack of emotional complexity, Sookshmadarshini carves out its identity with its unique storytelling.

## Conclusion

Sookshmadarshini is an engaging thriller with a clever narrative. Despite its flaws, it offers a fresh take on the genre, combining humor and suspense in a way that holds attention. While it might not reach the emotional highs of classics like Drishyam, it remains a commendable addition to Malayalam cinema.
