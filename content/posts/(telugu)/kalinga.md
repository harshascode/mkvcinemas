## Review

Review
"Kalinga" is not just another horror flick; it is a well-crafted journey into the unknown. The story centers around Dhruva Vaayu’s character, an ordinary man who faces extraordinary and terrifying events that challenge his beliefs about reality and superstition.

The film’s cinematography, done by Akshay Ram Podishetti, beautifully contrasts the eerie village setting with the suspenseful narrative. Each scene is meticulously shot to enhance the horror elements, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

The editing by Naresh Venuvanka keeps the pace tight, ensuring there are no dull moments. The music by Vishnu Sekhara adds a layer of tension, making quiet scenes resonate with fear.

Overall, "Kalinga" is an impressive addition to Telugu cinema's horror genre. It combines technical brilliance with strong performances, especially from Dhruva Vaayu and Pragya Nayan. Their portrayal of bravery in the face of fear transforms the film into more than just a horror story—it becomes a tale of courage and resilience.
