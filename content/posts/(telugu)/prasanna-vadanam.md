## Review

Debutant director Arjun Y K shows potential in crafting a suspenseful thriller, though the film could benefit from a tighter, faster-paced screenplay. The film’s music, scored by Vijay Bulganin, enhances critical moments, while S Chandrasekaran’s cinematography and Karthika Srinivas’s editing help deliver some tense scenes.

Suhas shines as a man struggling with Face Blindness, showcasing his versatility in this emotionally intense role. Rashi Singh takes a bold step in portraying a negative character, bringing depth to her performance. Payal Radhakrishna and Harsha Chemudu give solid performances, while Nitin Prasanna leaves a mark in his role.

While the film offers thrilling moments, the pacing and some unnecessary scenes slightly weaken the overall impact. However, the unexpected intermission twist and some intense scenes in the second half redeem the experience.
