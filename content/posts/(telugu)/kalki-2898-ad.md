## Review

“Kalki 2898 AD” excels in its captivating narrative and grand visual presentation. Prabhas impresses as Bhairava, with a charismatic and nuanced performance. Amitabh Bachchan’s portrayal of Ashwatthama is a standout, delivering power with minimal dialogue. Deepika Padukone brings emotional weight to her role, while Kamal Haasan embodies the menacing Yaskin with flair.

The film’s second half is action-packed, featuring breathtaking fight sequences and stunning visuals. The climax leaves viewers eagerly awaiting the sequel. While the film’s slower start may test some viewers' patience, it ultimately delivers a thrilling cinematic experience.
