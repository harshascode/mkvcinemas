## Review

Lucky Lakshman dives into the life of Sohel, a middle-class guy who struggles with strained relationships—with his parents, his girlfriend, and even his friends. His life takes a sudden turn when an unexpected incident shifts his perspective, pushing him to see what truly matters.

The film does a good job portraying relatable themes like family, friendship, and resilience. Sohel’s journey feels genuine, and Syed Sohel Ryan gives a heartfelt performance that makes his character’s struggles and triumphs believable. Mokksha and Raja Ravindra shine in their supporting roles, adding depth and emotional balance to the story.

While the storyline connects well with audiences, some viewers might feel that certain scenes run a bit long or that the plot is predictable at times. However, Lucky Lakshman still manages to deliver an inspiring story with moments of humor and important life lessons.

If you’re a fan of family dramas that emphasize self-discovery and the value of relationships, Lucky Lakshman is worth a watch.
