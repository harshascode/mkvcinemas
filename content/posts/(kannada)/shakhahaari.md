## Review

Shakhahaari revolves around Subbanna (played by Rangayana Raghu), a small hotel owner, and Mallikarjun (Gopalkrishna Deshpande), a police officer on the verge of a life-changing transfer. The plot thickens when a murder accused escapes, intertwining their lives in unexpected ways.

The film is filled with engaging dialogues and moments of tension that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Rangayana Raghu shines with his exceptional comic timing and emotional depth, while Gopalkrishna Deshpande impresses with his portrayal of a man under pressure. Both actors skillfully convey the vulnerability of their characters, drawing the audience into their struggles.

However, while the film starts strong, it loses some steam towards the end. A climactic face-off promises intensity but wraps up a bit too neatly, leaving some questions unanswered. Despite this, Sunkad's direction and the solid performances keep the audience invested.

Overall, Shakhahaari stands out as a quality addition to Kannada cinema in 2024, offering a blend of suspense and human emotion that resonates well.
